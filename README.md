# Mosquito-Warfare
-------------------

This is a first-person shooter I have created in 2020 as a part of an extracurricular game development course in ITMO University, Saint-Petersburg, Russia.

This game was created in a team, together with Ilya Kiss, Yaroslav Mikhailov and Andrei Shvayko-Shvaykovsky.
That being said, majority of the modeling, scripting and development was performed by me.

I am unsure if I am able to provide source files for this game, as the last time I worked with Unity was in 2020, and I only have access to the latest build of the game.

Majority of models are moddelled in blender and sculpted in zbrush. Some additional models, as well as animations, are downloaded from Mixamo.com.

None of the music used in the game belongs to me.
